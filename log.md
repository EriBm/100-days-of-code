##### Basic NodeJS Course

**Today's Progress**: Create CRUD with Node, Express, HBS and MongoDB. Start use the MongoDB Atlas.

**Thoughts:** I love NodeJS, it's so simple and intuitive, with few lines you can create an app with full functionality, and MongoDB has changed a lot since I used it in 2015, I was surprised by the number of improvements and tools that have been developed.
