# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 04, 2019
##### Basic NodeJS Course

**Today's Progress**: Create CRUD with Node, Express, HBS and MongoDB. Start use the MongoDB Atlas.

**Thoughts:** I love NodeJS, it's so simple and intuitive, with few lines you can create an app with full functionality, and MongoDB has changed a lot since I used it in 2015, I was surprised by the number of improvements and tools that have been developed.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
